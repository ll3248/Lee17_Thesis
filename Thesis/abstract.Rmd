Networks see usage in across many disciplines. This work focuses on social networks, a category of networks which tend to exhibit some characteristics unique to themselves. Is it possible to model social networks despite their unique properties? To answer this question, we begin with an overview of networks, including network statistics, and graph models. I look at the Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz models as well as exponential random graph models (ERGMs). We conduct a simulation study where we apply various graph models to an observed network. Here, we choose to analyze a component of the Facebook network. We compare the network statistics of this Facebook network with those calculated from graphs of parable magnitude simulated from their respective graph models. We conclude that models such as the Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz models do not accurately fit the Facebook network for these network statistics. ERGMs that only use combinations of edge, triangle, and k-star parameters also do not accurately model this Facebook network as well. However, the results suggest that adding other parameters can significantly improve simulation results.
