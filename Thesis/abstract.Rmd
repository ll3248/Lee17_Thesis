Networks see usage in across many disciplines. We will focus on social networks, a category of which that tend to exhibit some characteristics unique to themselves. Is it possible to model social networks despite this uniqueness? To answer this, we begin with an overview of networks, network statistics, and graph models. We decide to look at Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz models as well as exponential random graph models (ERGMs). We conduct a simulation study where we apply various graph models onto an observed network; here, we choose to analyze a component of the Facebook network. We compare the network statistics of this Facebook network with those calculated from graphs of parable magnitude simulated from their respective graph models. We conclude that models such as the Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz models do not seem to accurately fit the Facebook network for these network statistics. Work on applying ERGMs and fitting them to the Facebook network is still a current work in progress.
