# Corrections {.unnumbered} 
  \setcounter{chapter}{5}
	\setcounter{section}{0}

We corrected 24 typographical errors throughout the thesis. Major changes among these include several mathematical derivations that had errors. For example, there was parenthesis error in deriving the limit of the factor $(1 - p)^{N_{V} - 1 - k}$ factor of probability $p_{k}$ for the Erdős-Rényi model. The probability $p_{k}$ of the Wattts-Strogatz model was also originally incorrect, as there was an error in the denominator; it was supposed to be $(k - r)!$ rather than just $k - r$. Other minor changes include turning ordinary letters into in-line mathematical symbols (e.g. "a graph G" versus "a graph $G$"), incorrect word choice (e.g. "edges" instead of "vertices"), incorrect figure reference (e.g. Figure 3.2 instead of Figure 2.2, as intended), and miscellaneous grammatical errors. 
There were also four footnote errors that we corrected. In the original file, the footnotes in the Introduction, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2 did not display the correct text. There were also seven instances where table references in the chapters and the appendices were not referencing the correct item. We have corrected this in both sections. 


There were 21 instances where we revised, added, and/or rearranged words, sentences and/or paragraphs for the sake of clarity. There were 1 instances of removing entire sentences for the sake of conciseness (e.g. the explanation of power law distribution). 
We also added a decription regarding scaling when it comes to comparing centraliy measures in the lawyer and karate examples and in the simulation study. Because the networks we are comparing having approximately the same number of vertices, it is possible for us to compare their centrality measures without having to scale them. 
We also included a deeper description of the contents recorded in each table in the beginning of Chapter 3--this emphasizes that the values in the cells of the table are either the true value of the network statistic associated with the Facebook network or an estimate for each model along with a standard deviation. This was further emphasized by the addition of "(estimate $pm$ standard deviation)" in the description of each table. 
We also added a table of average network statistics for the lawyer and karate networks to summarize our results. The tables in Chapter 3 have also been updated with abbreviations to the names of network statistics and a reduced number of digits in the estimated values so that we are only working with three or four significant figures. 
We made two edits to the headers of code chunks so that the code chunk does not actually run when the file itself is being knit. We do not need them to run because the images that they generate have already been inserted into the body of the text through other means.


There was an issue citing certain sources, namely, Koleczyk's books, that were referenced in the text manually with intext-citations but ended up not appearing in the References section; we added these citations to References manually. We also added 5 other referenes that may prove helpful in further research (e.g. Becky Danning '16's undergraduate thesis). We also added 1 additional in-text citations throughout the thesis.
