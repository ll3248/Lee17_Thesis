# Revisions

Two typographical error were corrected throughout the thesis. These changes include turning some letters into in-line mathematical symbols (e.g. "a graph G" versus "a graph $G$"). 

There were also three footnote errors that did not display the intended information in the Introduction, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2.
